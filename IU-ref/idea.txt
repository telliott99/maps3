a segment is just a series of points
these points are very finely spaced
the first two points in segment 0 of I-10.txt

-117.0652,34.0039
-117.0650,34.0036

it seems that we should be able to detect 
overlaps between segments say

p <----------------------> q
              s <----------------------->t

b/c point s = x,y should then be in the bbox for pq
xmin < s.x < xmax
ymin < s.y < ymax

in fact, for simple routes
p.x < s.x < q.x
p.y < x.y < q.y
or vice-versa

so then the idea would be to write code to find these overlapping segments, and then merge them.

Take the segment of I-10 starting at CA-AZ border

9
33.5665,-113.3351
33.6048,-114.5307
271

The reverse of this is on our route.  The question is whether any other segment overlaps significantly.  (Except for 8, which is essentially identical.

(It seems unlikely, since otherwise my joining endpoints method would probably not work with only 300 segments).

And indeed, there is none.

So maybe this approach is not really applicable.
