scrape.py grabs the data for a US Highway in multiple states
and saves it to a new shapefile

it also makes a plot
for US Hwy 101 there are a couple gaps

collect_highway.py is similar to extract.py but works on US highways

endpoints.py works on the resulting U-101.txt, giving U-101-ends.txt

and then trace-route3.py works on that, gaps caused trouble

I found it easier to not save the intermediate runs but rather paste good sections together by hand.

It's also helpful to go over the route in reverse.
reverse.py reverses to standard orientation, starting in Los Angeles.

one gap looks like

north of Crescent City CA to the border
41.866,-124.228

and another in Mendocino Co.
39.437,-123.360

looking at my segments, 
those were problem spots where the data is certainly missing
