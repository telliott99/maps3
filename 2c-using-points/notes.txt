I've come to the conclusion that getting a "route", an ordered sequence of whatever geometry is in an interstate shapefile is both

- not possible for US Highways without a lot of work
- not really necessary

as a first example, we filter the I-5 data using the latitudes
of Los Angeles and Sacramento
as I-5 in north-south, it works great

in passing, I figured out what seems to be the GeoPandas way
to filter for more complicated selectors
turn the selector into a df and concat it to the original

-----

now, where can this general approach give trouble?
only on a meandering road that meanders near the endpoints!
I can deal with that situation as it comes.

even SE-NW or SW-NE seems like it should work

the next step is to factor the example into re-usable code.

the nice thing is that the results can be saved as shapefiles easily.
